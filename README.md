# Corelib

Corelib is mainly a Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for PHP. It focuses on flexibility and ease of use.

## Example

```php
<?php
// get Data Access Object (DAO) which allows to read isntances from storage
$userDAO = \Corelib\User\UserFactory::getUserDAO();

//get Data Storage OBject (DSO) which allwos us to store isntances into storage
$userDSO = \Corelib\User\UserFactory::getUserDSO();

$userCollection = $userDAO->search("email LIKE '%@gmail.com' AND emailConfirmed = {$userDAO->boolean(true)}");

foreach ($userCollection as $userBO) {
    echo "Locking user {$userBO->getName()} <{$userBO->getEmail()}>";
    
    $userBO->setLocked(true);
    
    try {
        $userDSO->save($userBO);
    } catch (Exception $e)  {
        echo "Problem saving user {$userBO->getName()";
    }
}
```
